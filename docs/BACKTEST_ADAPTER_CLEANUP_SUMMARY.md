# Backtest Adapter Enhanced - Cleanup Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Redundant Risk Management Inputs
- **Risk-Free Rate (Annual %)** - Removed from "Sharpe Calculation" group
  - This was only used for Sharpe ratio calculations but not for actual risk management
  - Simplified Sharpe calculation to use return/volatility ratio instead
  
- **Risk Per Trade (%)** - Removed from "Risk Management" group
  - This was redundant since the system now uses ATR-based position sizing
  - Fixed 10% risk per trade is now hardcoded for consistency

### 2. Enhanced Signal Source Documentation
- Added comprehensive setup instructions for Lorentzian Classification Enhanced
- Clear explanation of signal values:
  - Long signals = 1 (green)
  - Short signals = -1 (red)
  - Exit signals = 2 (for long exits) or -2 (for short exits)

### 3. Simplified Risk Management
- **Fixed 10% risk per trade** - No user input required
- **ATR-based stop loss** - 2x ATR with minimum distance enforcement
- **Automatic position sizing** - Calculated as: (Account Equity × 0.10) ÷ Stop Loss Distance
- **Timeframe-based caps** - Automatic position size limits based on chart timeframe

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Cleaner UI** - Removed confusing/duplicate inputs
2. **Consistent Risk** - Fixed 10% risk per trade ensures uniform exposure
3. **Better Documentation** - Clear setup instructions for Lorentzian Classification Enhanced
4. **Simplified Operation** - Users only need to set signal source and start date
5. **Professional Grade** - Institutional-level risk management without complexity

## Current Input Structure

### Backtest Time Period
- Begin Backtest at Start Date (checkbox)
- Start Date (date/time picker)

### General Settings  
- Signal Source (dropdown with enhanced tooltip)

### Removed Sections
- ~~Sharpe Calculation~~ (risk-free rate removed)
- ~~Risk Management~~ (risk per trade removed)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Add Lorentzian Classification Enhanced** to your chart
2. **Enable "Show Default Exits"** in indicator settings
3. **Set Signal Source** to the Lorentzian Classification indicator output
4. **Set Start Date** for backtesting period
5. **Run Strategy** - all risk management is automatic

## Technical Details

- **Position Sizing**: `(Equity × 0.10) ÷ Stop Loss Distance`
- **Stop Loss**: `2 × ATR` with minimum distance enforcement
- **Timeframe Caps**: Automatic limits based on chart period
- **Risk Per Trade**: Fixed at 10% for consistency
- **Sharpe Calculation**: Simplified return/volatility ratio

The script now provides a clean, professional interface focused on the essential inputs while maintaining institutional-grade risk management behind the scenes.
