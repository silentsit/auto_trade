act as a quant python developer with 20 years experience trading FX and managing portfolios at some of the top tier-one hedge funds in the world. one of your main responsibilities was to develop and manage institutional-grade high frequency trading bots across multiple asset classes.

my current bot now relies on receiving close signal alerts to exit positions.

i would like to add an additional function - where if the position meets certain conditions, the bot ignores the close signal alert and allows for profits to ride, by setting an initial ATR-based stop loss and take profit with the broker.

Questions: 1. what do you think those conditions should be?

note that i only trade on the 15 min, 1h, and/or 4h time-frames.

attached is a copy of my last conversation transcript with gemini ai, my current bot’s (011) codes.

## Executive Summary

You want a **“profit-riding” override** that keeps winning trades open even when the Pine-Script sends a CLOSE alert, provided the market context justifies it.  
For 15-min, 1-h, 4-h time-frames the most robust conditions are **volatility, regime, and momentum filters** that tell us whether the trend still has room to run.

## 1\. Recommended Override Conditions (ranked)

| # | Condition | Rationale | How to implement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Regime = TRENDING (Lorentzian classifier) | Trends on 15-240 min bars often persist for 3–8 bars; premature exits hurt expectancy. | if regime_classifier.regime.endswith("trending") → allow ride |
| 2 | Volatility < 1.5× mean | High-vol spikes can whipsaw trailing stops; low-to-moderate vol lets winners run. | if volatility_monitor.volatility_ratio < 1.5 → allow ride |
| 3 | Momentum > 0.15 ATR per bar | Measured as (current_price – SMA(10))/ATR > 0.15; strong directional momentum. | if (price - sma10) / atr > 0.15 → allow ride |
| 4 | Consecutive higher highs (last 3 bars) | Visual confirmation of continued trend on the chosen TF. | Simple price comparison loop |
| 5 | Risk-adjusted profit ≥ 1R | Ensures we already locked the original risk before overriding. | if unrealized_pnl >= initial_risk_amount → allow ride |

**Override logic**:

**All** of (1) OR (2) **AND** (3) OR (4) **AND** (5) must be TRUE to **ignore** the CLOSE alert and instead set ATR-based SL/TP.

## 2\. Code Sketch (drop-in)

Create a new module profit\_ride\_override.py:

  
from dataclasses import dataclass  
from typing import Dict, Any  
from utils import get\_atr, get\_instrument\_type  
from regime\_classifier import LorentzianDistanceClassifier  
from volatility\_monitor import VolatilityMonitor  
from position\_journal import Position  
  
@dataclass  
class OverrideDecision:  
ignore\_close: bool  
sl\_atr\_multiple: float = 2.0 # widen to 2× ATR  
tp\_atr\_multiple: float = 4.0 # lengthen to 4× ATR  
  
class ProfitRideOverride:  
def \_\_init\_\_(self, regime: LorentzianDistanceClassifier, vol: VolatilityMonitor):  
self.regime = regime  
self.vol = vol  
  
async def should\_override(self, position: Position, current\_price: float) -> OverrideDecision:  
atr = await get\_atr(position.symbol, position.timeframe)  
if atr <= 0:  
return OverrideDecision(ignore\_close=False)  
  
\# 1. Regime filter  
reg = self.regime.get\_regime\_data(position.symbol)\["regime"\]  
is\_trending = "trending" in reg  
  
\# 2. Volatility filter  
vol\_state = self.vol.get\_volatility\_state(position.symbol)  
vol\_ok = vol\_state\["volatility\_ratio"\] < 1.5  
  
\# 3. Momentum filter  
sma10 = ... # fetch 10-period SMA (reuse utils or cache)  
momentum = abs(current\_price - sma10) / atr  
strong\_momentum = momentum > 0.15  
  
\# 4. Higher-highs (3 bars)  
hh = await self.\_higher\_highs(position.symbol, position.timeframe, 3)  
  
\# 5. Risk-adjusted profit  
initial\_risk = abs(position.entry\_price - position.stop\_loss) \* position.size  
realized\_ok = position.pnl >= initial\_risk  
  
ignore = (is\_trending or vol\_ok) and (strong\_momentum or hh) and realized\_ok  
  
return OverrideDecision(  
ignore\_close=ignore,  
sl\_atr\_multiple=2.0 if ignore else 1.5,  
tp\_atr\_multiple=4.0 if ignore else 2.5  
)  
  
async def \_higher\_highs(self, symbol: str, tf: str, bars: int) -> bool:  
\# Use existing price history or fetch candles  
candles = await ... # 3 last candles  
return all(candles\[i+1\].high > candles\[i\].high for i in range(bars-1))

## 3\. Integration into alert\_handler.py

In process\_alert() when direction == "CLOSE":

  
from profit\_ride\_override import ProfitRideOverride  
override = ProfitRideOverride(regime\_classifier, volatility\_monitor)  
  
decision = await override.should\_override(position\_obj, current\_price)  
  
if decision.ignore\_close:  
\# 1. Cancel any pending exit order (if you sent one earlier)  
\# 2. Attach new ATR-based SL & TP to the broker  
sl = current\_price - decision.sl\_atr\_multiple \* atr # adjust sign for BUY/SELL  
tp = current\_price + decision.tp\_atr\_multiple \* atr  
await self.\_update\_broker\_sl\_tp(position\_id, sl, tp)  
logger.info(f"Profit-ride override active for {symbol}")  
return {"status": "profit\_ride", "message": "Close alert ignored, ATR SL/TP set"}  
else:  
\# proceed with normal close

## 4\. Risk Controls (must-have)

1.  **Maximum ride time**: 8 bars on the timeframe (e.g., 8×15 min = 2 h)  
    
2.  **Hard stop on equity drawdown > 3 %**  
    
3.  **Override can only fire once per position** (store flag in Position metadata)

## 5\. Testing Plan

| Scenario | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Trending low-vol EUR_USD after 1.5R profit | Override → TP widened |
| Ranging high-vol GBP_JPY | No override → close executed |
| Momentum fades below 0.15 ATR/bar | Override cancelled |

Run **walk-forward Monte-Carlo** on 3-month 15-min and 4-h EUR\_USD & GBP\_USD to verify **expectancy uplift ≥ 0.2R per trade** before deploying live.

You now have a **systematic override** that lets winners run only when the **regime, volatility, and momentum filters** align, backed by strict risk rules.

**User:**

how will tp be calculated?

**Kimi:**

## TP Calculation in Profit-Ride Override

When the override is triggered, the **Take-Profit** is recalculated **once** from the **current market price** using a **fixed ATR multiple**.  
There is **no trailing adjustment**—it is a static target that replaces the Pine-Script exit.

### 1\. Formula (per side)

| Direction | TP Price |
| --- | --- |
| BUY | current_price + (tp_atr_multiple × ATR) |
| SELL | current_price - (tp_atr_multiple × ATR) |

where

*   current\_price = last tick when the override fires
*   ATR = 14-period ATR on the **same timeframe** (15 m, 1 h, or 4 h)
*   tp\_atr\_multiple = 4.0 by default (configurable)

### 2\. Code Snippet (inside override)

  
atr = await get\_atr(symbol, position.timeframe)  
sign = 1 if position.action == "BUY" else -1  
tp\_price = current\_price + sign \* decision.tp\_atr\_multiple \* atr

### 3\. Example

**Trade**: Long EUR\_USD on 1 h

*   Entry = 1.1050
*   ATR (1 h, 14) = 0.0012 (12 pips)
*   Override triggers at 1.1090

TP = 1.1090 + 4 × 0.0012 = **1.1138** (fixed).

### 4\. Edge Cases & Safeguards

| Case | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ATR ≤ 0 or NaN | Fallback to static 50-pip target |
| TP beyond broker max distance | Cap at 100 pips |
| Symbol has different pip value (JPY pairs) | Use get_pip_value() for scaling |

This gives you a **single, deterministic TP** that scales with **real-time volatility**, ensuring winners can ride without manual intervention.

**User:**

and how is stop loss calculated?

**Kimi:**

## Stop-Loss Calculation in Profit-Ride Override

When the override is **active**, the **initial ATR-based Stop-Loss** is **re-calculated once** from the **current market price** and sent to the broker.  
It is **static** (not trailing) and **replaces** any previous exit logic.

### 1\. Formula (per side)

| Direction | Stop-Loss Price |
| --- | --- |
| BUY | current_price – (sl_atr_multiple × ATR) |
| SELL | current_price + (sl_atr_multiple × ATR) |

where

*   current\_price = last tick when override fires
*   ATR = 14-period ATR on the **same timeframe** (15 m, 1 h, 4 h)
*   sl\_atr\_multiple = **2.0** by default (configurable)

### 2\. Code Snippet (inside override)

  
atr = await get\_atr(symbol, position.timeframe)  
sign = 1 if position.action == "BUY" else -1  
sl\_price = current\_price - sign \* decision.sl\_atr\_multiple \* atr

### 3\. Real Example

**Trade**: Long GBP\_USD on 4 h

*   Current price = 1.2500
*   ATR (4 h, 14) = 0.0030 (30 pips)
*   Override triggers → SL = 1.2500 – 2 × 0.0030 = **1.2440**

### 4\. Safety Checks

| Edge Case | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ATR ≤ 0 | Fallback to 1 % of current price |
| SL too tight (< 5 pips) | Min stop = 5 pips |
| SL beyond broker limit | Cap at 200 pips |
| Symbol is JPY | Use get_pip_value() to convert ATR to JPY pips |

### 5\. Broker Order Payload

  
{  
"order": {  
"type": "STOP",  
"instrument": "GBP\_USD",  
"units": 0,  
"price": "1.2440",  
"timeInForce": "GTC"  
}  
}

This single, **volatility-scaled SL** locks in downside protection while still giving the trend room to breathe during the profit-ride phase.

**User:**

how was tp and sl calculated in may script? and how does it differ from your current proposed calculation? include simple examples to show me the difference clearly

**Kimi:**

## May Script vs. Current Override – TP/SL Calculation Head-to-Head

| Aspect | May Script (old) | Current Override (new) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anchor | Entry Price only (fixed once) | Current Market Price (dynamic at override) |
| ATR Multiple | SL = 2 × ATR, TP = 3 × ATR | SL = 2 × ATR, TP = 4 × ATR (configurable) |
| When set | Once, at trade open | Once, when override fires |
| Updates | Never | Never (static after override) |

### 1\. Simple Numeric Example – Same Trade

**Instrument**: EUR\_USD, 1 h

**ATR (1 h, 14)**: 0.0010 (10 pips)

**Entry**: 1.1000

| Scenario | May Script | Current Override (override fires at 1.1020) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stop-Loss | 1.1000 − 2×10 pips = 1.0980 (20 pips risk) | 1.1020 − 2×10 pips = 1.1000 (20 pips risk) |
| Take-Profit | 1.1000 + 3×10 pips = 1.1030 (30 pips target) | 1.1020 + 4×10 pips = 1.1060 (40 pips target) |

### 2\. Visual Side-by-Side

  
May Script (at open)  
Entry 1.1000  
SL 1.0980 (–20)  
TP 1.1030 (+30)  
  
Override fires at 1.1020  
SL 1.1000 (–20 from 1.1020)  
TP 1.1060 (+40 from 1.1020)

### 3\. Key Differences Summed Up

| Difference | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Anchor moves from entry to current price | Locks in profits already gained; SL becomes breakeven or better. |
| TP multiple increases (3 → 4) | Gives the trend extra room to run without manual intervention. |
| Set only once, but at override time | Maintains institutional discipline (no dynamic trailing yet) while still capturing additional upside. |

### 4\. Take-away

*   **May Script**: Rigid 3:2 risk-reward, anchored at entry.
*   **Current Override**: **Breakeven-plus SL**, **wider TP**, anchored at **latest price** when override triggers—designed to **let winners run** under favorable regime/volatility conditions.
